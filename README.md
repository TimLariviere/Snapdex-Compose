_Check out [Snapdex ‚Äì SwiftUI Edition](https://github.com/TimLariviere/Snapdex-SwiftUI) to see my SwiftUI development in action._

Snapdex is a production-quality **Pok√©dex-style app** built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Users can snap pictures of Pokemon merch found in the wild (plushes, trading cards, etc) to complete their own Pok√©dex thanks to AI-powered recognition (TensorFlow Lite and OpenAI). This project is designed to serve both as a **learning experience** and a **professional showcase** of modern Android development skills.

## üì± How to Build

1. Run `dotnet fsi Init.fsx` to seed the database and download the Pokemon assets used by the app
2. Generate a keystore file to sign the app
3. Create `signing.properties` with the following properties:
   ```
   storeFile=<Relative path to the generated keystore file>
   storePassword=<Password of the keystore file>
   keyAlias=<Alias of the key>
   keyPassword=<Password of the key>
   ```
4. Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
5. Configure the Firebase project for Android (Auth, Firestore, Analytics, Crashlytics)
6. Download `google-services.json` from Firebase and paste it to `app/google-services.json`
7. Run `./gradlew buildAllRelease` to generate the APK/AAB
